Welcome to xemc3's documentation!

:py:mod:`xemc3` provides an interface for collecting the output data
from a ``EMC3`` simulation into an xarray_ dataset, as well as accessor
methods for common EMC3 analysis and plotting tasks.

Currently only in alpha (until 1.0 released) so please report any
bugs, and feel free to raise issues asking questions or making
suggestions.
