    "There are several ways to customise.\n",

    "### Extending existing profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading the configuration provided by xemc3, xemc3 looks for a user provided file, in `~/.local/xemc3/<name>.yaml` where `<name>` is e.g. `default`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending all profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "xemc3 also reads the file `~/.local/xemc3/files.yaml`. This file has lower priority then user provided `<names>.yaml`, but higher than xemc3 provided `<name>.yaml`. Thus it can be used to override things by xemc3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to extending existing profiles, it is possible to create on profiles. Just like in the case of extending a profile, `~/.local/xemc3/<name>.yaml` is read. In that case all needed files need to be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The file is using the yaml syntax. Note that while yaml does not is specified to preserve order, xemc3 requires the order for the `vars` key, as that specifies in which order the blocks are in the file. While all tested yaml reader preserve the order when reading, care has to be taken if the file is written from python.\n",
